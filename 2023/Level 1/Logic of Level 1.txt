Part a:

The logic is that we read each string from both sides until we find a digit. Then after we find the digit reading from the front and the digit reading from the back we combine them.
(e.g. 6tvxlgrsevenjvbxbfqrsk4seven when reading it from left to right we find the 6 and from right to left we find the 4). Combining those 2 together gives us 64. 
After that we add the 64 to a variable called sum.

Part b:

The logic is the same part as part a but this time we need to count the strings as numbers as well(e.g. two1nine has when reading it from left to right we find the string "two" and from right to left we find the string "nine") 
These strings must be transformed to digits and them follow the combination logic.
